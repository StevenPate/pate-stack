# Steven Pate

## ðŸ¤³

I'm a builder of websites and online experiences. My background has been in web content management and front-end development, and my recent focus has been strategy and user experience for e-commerce. The work I have found most gratifying has elements of project management, research, information design and content strategy, and my passions all involve storytelling, learning and connecting to the wider world.

I feel particularly gratified to have help bridge technical divides and most enjoy working with true believers. I'm newly transplanted to Seattle and looking for my next opportunity, especially if that is at a great bookshop that wants to build a new kind of online experience. I have a lot of ideas! Check out [what I'm up to right now](/now).
