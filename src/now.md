# What I'm Doing Now

## ‚è∞

Trail Angel-ing season is over! We hosted about twenty hikers thru-hiking the Pacific Northwest Trail this year, and while it is so fun to meet and help these adventurous souls, but it takes a bit of a toll on our family of introverts. As nice as it is to share our space with creatures-of-the-trail, it will be nice to have it to ourselves during the winter.

When not working on the house or being a full-time dad to a very full-time four-and-a-half-year-old, I am a bookseller and handling technology for a magnificent local indie bookstore, <a href="https://portbooknews.com">Port Book and News</a>.  

The bookstore just came up for sale. I would love to buy it, but probably need some help. Want to help me? Let me know! I have a ton of ideas. An <em>imperial</em> ton, even. 

Otherwise I van be found having fun outside, writing about reading, thinking about coding, and getting to know our new community.
