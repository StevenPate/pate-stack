# What I'm Doing Now

## ‚è∞

I have just moved to Port Angeles, Washington, just a couple of miles from Olympic National Park on (you guessed it) the Olympic Peninsula. Mountains, beaches, forests are all right here,  and of course I've been exploring and biking and hiking and running everywhere I can. I'm still a full-time dad to the funniest and fastest two-year-old kid you have ever seen. I'm starting a bit more web strategy and development work as I spend some shreds of free time on taking my pandemic project public. I have this idea about building a great online bookstore experience, which I have begun to document at <a href="https://bookshelves.dev">bookshelves.dev</a>. I recently went along on my first work party with the Washington Trails Association doing trail maintenance, and that was incredibly fun and rewarding. I'm looking forward to a summer of being outside a lot, writing about reading, thinking about coding, and getting to know a new community.</p>
