# What I'm Doing Now

## ‚è∞

After settling in Port Angeles, Washington, I purchased a wonderful little house on a bit of land just outside of Port Angeles (a half a mile from Olympic National Park) with my partner and permanent trail companion Rosie. We are elated and overwhelmed at the prospect of making it our own and managing it all.

I'm starting a bit more web strategy and development work as I spend some shreds of free time on taking my pandemic project public. I have this idea about building a great online bookstore experience, which I have begun to document at <a href="https://bookshelves.dev">bookshelves.dev</a>. 

I recently went along on a few work parties with the Washington Trails Association doing trail maintenance, and that was incredibly fun and rewarding. 

When not working on the house or being a full-time dad to a very full-time two-and-a-half-year-old, I'm having fun outside, writing about reading, thinking about coding, and getting to know a new community.
